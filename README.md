# FHIR-Modelling-RMDTriage
FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) - a conversational system for general practitioners to support referral to rheumatology examination and education for rheumatic diseases.
This IG provides a FHIR-based framework for a conversational decision support system designed to assist practitioners in the early identification of patients who may benefit from a rheumatology referral. By leveraging structured symptom input and evidence-based guidance, the system helps practitioners evaluate potential inflammatory arthritis cases and streamline referral workflows.
In addition, the IG supports patient-facing educational components tailored to those in remission or with low disease activity, fostering shared decision-making and long-term disease management.
This guide defines FHIR profiles, terminology bindings, and workflow patterns to ensure interoperability with electronic health record systems, clinical decision support tools, and patient engagement platforms.
